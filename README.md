# The assumptions made:

Font Family: The dropdown menu allows the user to select a font family for the text. It's assumed that the list contains a variety of commonly used font families.

Variant: The dropdown menu allows the user to select a font variant, like regular, bold, or italic. It's assumed that the list contains the available variants for the selected font family.

Bold and Italic: These buttons control whether the text is bold and/or italic.

Text Area: The large box in the middle is where the text appears, styled based on the selected font family, variant, and style.

Reset and Save: The buttons at the bottom allow the user to reset the text to its default settings or save the current settings.
